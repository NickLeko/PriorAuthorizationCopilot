# Prior Authorization Readiness Copilot (Flagship)

## Overview
Administrative decision-support system that evaluates PA readiness,
identifies missing requirements, and drafts payer-aligned justification letters.

## Problem
Prior authorizations fail due to incomplete documentation, unclear medical
necessity language, and payer-specific rules — not clinical quality.

## Solution
Rules-based readiness evaluation + LLM-assisted drafting with full auditability.

## What This System Does
- Scores PA readiness
- Flags missing or weak requirements
- Drafts justification letters
- Preserves clinician control

## What This System Does NOT Do
- Predict approval
- Provide medical advice
- Override payer policy

## Architecture
(rules engine + LLM write-only layer)

## Evaluation
Synthetic cases, readiness accuracy, missingness detection

## Status
Flagship project — under active development
